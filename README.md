# Macro Flask Classifier

This repo hosts a Flask server to run food classification processes to send to the api.

## Architecture

App.py hosts uses flask to create a webserver to communicate with the api and run classification.

## Setup

All files within this repo can be tested locally by running them with Python. Run `python3 app.py` and open the local server to see classification results. Enter different image urls in `app.py` to test with various foods.

## Deployment

The project is automatically deployed to Heroku and can be found [here](https://macroclassifier.herokuapp.com/)
